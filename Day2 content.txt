Types
1.overloading
a.operator overloading
b.method overloading
2.overriding
Overriding
if a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class it take it from its base class or parent class

DATA STRUCTURES
->Helps to write efficient programs
->Linear -arrary,linkedlist,stack,queue,matrix
->Non linear-binary tree,heap,graph,hashtable
linear-sorting data sequentially
non linear-no sequential style

static- size cannot be changed array
dynamic- size can be changed list,stack,queue

Linked list
ex:train
DEF:As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list
Types:single/singly
double/doubly
circular

Creating linked list:
Step-1:create the node
Step-2:partition the node wit two segments data&none
Step-3:add value into the blank node
Step-4:mark the node as head
Step-5:create the next node by following the above steps
Step-6:establish link between 1st &2nd node
Displaying linked list:
traversal is required from 1st nodetill tail node in order to display existing linked list
Operations:
1.insert
2.delete
3.search
