Binary node:
A node can have maximum 2 children

Binary tree traversal
3 types:
1.inorder:left-root-right l:d:r
2.postorder:left-right-root l:r:dclass binarytreenode:
3.preorder:root-left-right d:l:r

traversl are of 2 types
1.bfs-breadth first traversal
2.dfs-depth first traversal

Types of binary tree:
1.full binary tree:all nodes will have 2 or 0 children
             12
            /  \
           8   18
          / \
         5   7
2.degenerate or  pathalogical tree:every node zero or 1 child
              10
             /
            20
             \
             30
             /
            40
3.skewed tree:in which the tree is either left side or right side
skew tree is of 2 types:left skewed tree,right skewed tree
        1                         1
       /                           \
      2                             2
     /                               \
    3                                 3
 left skewed tree                right skewed tree
complete binary tree:every level should be full or complete
In last level if it is incomplete nodes should present at extreme left side
                      1
                     / \
                    2   3
                   / \
                  4   5

perfect binary tree:all internal nodes which has 2 childrens and leaf nodes both should be at same level
                            1
                           / \
                          2   3
                         / \ / \
                        4  5 6  7

balanced binary tree:for all the nodes height of  left subtree-right subtree can be 0 or 1

BSD(Binary Search Tree):all the left side elements should be lesser than its parent 
right side should be greater than parent
                  7
                 / \
                3   10
               / \    \
              2   5   12
